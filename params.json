{"name":"myBlockchain","tagline":"The world's most popular open source blockchain, and MyBlockchain Cluster, a real-time, open source transactional blockchain.","body":"### Why do we need private Blockchains?\r\n\r\nAs Bitcoin has passed its zenith and is being regulated into absurdity we are starting to realize how valuable the underlying technology of Bitcoin really is. Imagine being able to book flights or do shopping online, but without requiring a burdensome and complicated decentralized system and that troubling image in your head of stealing the lunch of an old white male banker in his penthouse that he so rightfully deserves.\r\n\r\nWhile myBlockchain might look like a cheap and shameless fork of some other popular software we would like to remind you that non-consensual and unscheduled forks have a long history in private blockchains, and we are proud to build on top of that.\r\n\r\n- Private Blockchains save costs, because we already have an expensive and inefficient regulatory system for legacy technology that we would otherwise have to recreate just for the few druggies using Bitcoin. We say no to wasting tax payers money!\r\n- Private Blockchains aren't scary at all, but they sure sound innovative nonetheless!\r\n- Private Blockchains are secure because security doesn't mean what you think it means.\r\n\r\nFor more information on our innovative blockchain technology please read through our [whitepaper](/what.html) or browse our [FAQ](/FAQ.html).\r\n\r\n### Private Blockchains in the press\r\n\r\n[Wired, Bitcoin May Never Make It to Wall Street, But Its Tech Will](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/nasdaq-bringing-bitcoin-closer-stock-market/)    \r\n[Wall Street Journal, Beyond Bitcoin, the Blockchain Looms Large](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2015/09/15/beyond-bitcoin-the-blockchain-looms-large/)    \r\n[Techworld, Why banks are betting on the blockchain - not bitcoin - to transform the financial sector](http://www.techworld.com/e-commerce/why-banks-are-betting-on-blockchain-transform-financial-sector-3621840/)    \r\n[Diginomica, It’s not about Bitcoin, it’s the blockchain stupid](http://diginomica.com/2015/04/13/its-not-about-bitcoin-its-the-blockchain-stupid/)    \r\n\r\n### Run myBlockchain\r\n\r\nAre you ready for fintech? Are you ready for exposing yourself to cutting edge technology without spending time to understand how it works? Are you ready for flashing fancy new business cards at congresses, luncheons and breakfast briefings, with pre- and postfixes like *bit, crypto, chain, coin, satoshi* or *block*?\r\n\r\n[myBlockchain is available for free](https://github.com/myblockchain/myblockchain), because we know you will pay us a lot of money to run it for you anyway. Compliance!\r\n\r\nStart your own blockchain with the following simple command:\r\n\r\n```CREATE TABLE blocks (     \r\n  id INT,     \r\n  previous_block_id INT     \r\n) TYPE=innodb;```\r\n\r\nDon't forget to generate the Genesis block! Everyone can feel like Satoshi in the private Blockchain world!\r\n\r\n```INSERT INTO blocks (id, previous_block_id) VALUES (42, NULL);```\r\n\r\nNow you are free to create your own transactions, make coins appear out of thin air, send them to yourself or your friends, censor the transactions of your competitors and collect transaction fees that are actually worth your time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
